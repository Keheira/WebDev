			<h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
			<p>A hackathon is a gathering where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over a short period of time. The term “hack” is commonly thought of hacking into a program or network with malicious intent. This is not what we are trying to accomplish here. The goal of the hackathon is collaborating to identify issues and create software solutions.</p><br />
            <h2>What is the hackathon about?</h2>
            <p>The hackathon gives North Carolina A&T students an opportunity to show their creativity, skills and talents.</p><br />
			<h2>Who can participate?</h2>
			<p>Any student that is a part of STARS, NSBE, or ACM.</p><br />
            <h2>Can I register as a team? Or as an individual?</h2>
            <p>Hackers should register individually and form their teams during the kickoff on April 17, 2015. We will have a team registration at the kickoff. Hackers have the option to work individually or in teams up up to 3 people. It's up to you! We're encouraging applications from lots of different backgrounds (Computer science, math, engineering, design, business and more)</p><br />
            <h2>Where will the hackathon be held?</h2>
            <p>McNair Auditorium</p>
			<h2>What if I want to leave during the competition, can I still participate?</h2>
			<p>Sure! We can't hold you hostage just remember that if you don't make it back before the time stated your team couldn be disqualified.</p><br />
			<h2>Are there prizes?</h2>
			<p>Yes! 1st place prize is $300, 2nd place is $150, and 3rd place is $75. Prizes are for the entire team not per individual.</p><br />
			<h2>Who are the judges?</h2>
			<p>Well.....that is a little surprise. Don't worry though because we are going to have people from different walks of life.</p><br />
			<h2> What will you be providing for the participants? What do I need bring?</h2>
			<p>There will be lots of pizza and drinks provided on April 18 after presentations. As a hacker, you'll need to bring your laptop, cellphone, charger, and anything else you might need to hack. </p>><br />
			<h2>Will there be anyone to help if I get stuck?</h2>
			<p>Yup! We have some great students to help in all aspects. The helpers won't code or present for you though.</p><br />
